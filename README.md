This a data analysis projects involving runners.
The name of the dataset used is rundata and it was obtained from kaggle. It comprises three columns (FirstRun, SecondRun and FinalRun).
The aim of the analysis was to determine the performerd of certain athlets who trained for a competition.
From the analysis carried out (using the codes on the R file attached on this repo) it was apparent that the the second time the athlets ran a race, they porformed better. This trend cound be seen clearly by 
ploting the density of First and Second run on the same plot.
